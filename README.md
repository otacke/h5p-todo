# h5p-todo

I thought it might be a good idea to better keep track of my ideas and todos related to H5P -- why not make that publicly?

## Coming next ...
- Brush up H5P Dictation (in code review)
- Create H5P Bingo just for fun/Anja Lorenz (beta version done)
- Add setAudio function to H5P Question (pull request)

## Issues for my existing stuff
I already use github issues to keep track of bugs, ideas, etc. for stuff that I have created. Please have a look there.

## Ideas and todos

### DONE <strike>H5P Bingo</strike>
<strike>
- Content type for playing bingo at boring conferences -- create your bingo sheet, share, enjoy ;-)
- Enter pool of bingo words, content type will randomly generate an x by x bingo sheet
</strike>

### DONE <strike>Add setAudio function to H5P Question (already in prototype state)</strike>
<strike>H5P Question is a library that offers common functionality to question-like content types. It already features setImage and setVideo for easily including an image or a video for the content types introduction, but setAudio is missing.</strike>

### Set slide duration for Course Presentation
It was nice if one could set a period of time after which a course presentations jumps to the next slide automatically. Might be fun for petcha kutcha or similar things. I already had some code to do this, but it got lost :-/

### H5P Paint
Just a content type to create some doodles and store them -- might be interesting to wrap images in xAPI ;-)

### H5P Annotate
Container like content type that will put something like a timeline-ish comment section next to other content types for (collaborative) annotation. Would need some mechanism for sharing data among users

### H5P Mandelbrot
Just for fun, a generator for fractals

### H5P Swipe
A content type/(library for other content types?) to answer yes, no, foo or bar by swiping left, right, up or down

### H5P GraphQuiz
I wrote that on a sheet of paper, but I cannot remember what I wanted to create named this way ;-)
Might have been something like Capira offered: Teachers can draw a graph as a sample, and learners have to draw a graph that's similar enough. Could as well have been something such as https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/

### Optionally store state in cookies
There's a save content state option that stores the state of a content type if the user is logged in. Might be useful to optionally use cookies (web storage API), so this feature could work for anonymous users, too. https://h5p.org/comment/14994#comment-14994

### Timer
I have already created a general timer library for H5P, quite versatile, but I do not even dare to look at that old piece of code ;-) Maybe I'll write something new, tiny and focussed and ready for adding a timer (maybe as an overlay) to any H5P library that needs one. Could also go into H5P-Question.

### H5P OnSite
In order so support blended learning scenarios that use xAPI statements, an on-site tool might be useful. It it's simplest version it could just trigger an xAPI statement for "attended" when someone (within a particular group/range) clicks a button. A more sophisticated version could also offer some audience response system features.

### Twitter library
Add support for OAuth and tracking hashtag

### Support Cornell Notes
Implement support for Cornell Notes, https://m.wikihow.com/Take-Cornell-Notes

### Audio-Recorder-Widget
Based on the Audio-Recorder content type, build an editor widget. Could be combined with the audio widget. (cmp. https://h5ptechnology.atlassian.net/browse/HFP-1145). 

### Word cloud
Simple content type (with possibly complex variations for fun): Create a word cloud from a list of words similar to https://www.wordclouds.com/

### Hangman
Self-explanatory. Maybe score + timing would be nice.

### IFTTT connection
Having an option to trigger IFTTT recipes based on xAPI statements could be real fun!

### Select for Fill in the blanks
Instead of free text blanks, fill in the blanks might also be used to optionally present a select input field with different options

### Question Set
Allow multi-tier-questions, cmp. https://h5p.org/node/204840

### Multiple-Choice
Add Discrete option mode, cmp. https://h5p.org/node/204855

### Code feedback
Is there a service with an open API that could be used to unit test code and return some results to H5P? ...

### 3D model display
It might be an interesting option to have a "3D image" content type that takes a standard 3D model file as input (research: what's standard?) and just displays it with some basic interaction options such as rotating or zooming. I bet there's already an open implementation for that (based on ThreeJS) that could be wrapped and used in H5P.

### Variable system
There might be cases where you want to (semi-)dynamically create content instead of creating several instances.
- Add variables, e. g. ${foo} that should not conflict with other texts.
- Add json file with possible values for a variable to h5p scheme.
- Big question: How to edit the files?

### Transcript library
A library that can be used to use (not create) transcripts with audio content or video content.
- Show transcript of an audio file/video file (based on .vtt captions or similar)
- Show currently used text phrase as audio/video progresses (on "caption" update, trigger with time as data)
- Jump to position in audio/video on clicking on the text (on click, trigger with time as data)

### Make rewind in IV more flexible
- Set time for rewinding
