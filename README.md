## Ideas and todos

### DONE <strike>H5P Bingo</strike>
<strike>
- Content type for playing bingo at boring conferences -- create your bingo sheet, share, enjoy ;-)
- Enter pool of bingo words, content type will randomly generate an x by x bingo sheet
</strike>

### DONE <strike>Add setAudio function to H5P Question (already in prototype state)</strike>
<strike>H5P Question is a library that offers common functionality to question-like content types. It already features setImage and setVideo for easily including an image or a video for the content types introduction, but setAudio is missing.</strike>

### DONE <strike>Add video option to dialog cards</strike>
<strike>Currently, dialog cards can contain images, but not videos. Having videos as well, could e.g. enable support for sign language.</strike>

### <strike>H5P.PDF</strike>
<strike>Simple PDF-Viewer content type, could be based on [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js). Rather not to prevent even more PDF overuse.</strike>

### DONE <strike>DialogCards</strike>
<strike>
- cmp. https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/unlock-spaced-repetition-for-h5p-dialog-cards/x/824080
- Save Content State
- Reset button for repetition mode to start over again
</strike>

### DONE BY SOMEONE ELSE <strike>Hangman</strike>
<strike>Self-explanatory. Maybe score + timing would be nice.</strike>

### DONE <strike>Auto-Progression for Image Slider</strike>
<strike>- Option to progress to the next image automatically after a given time period (should be reset after interaction?)
- Option to jump from last to first/first to last image instead of stopping (normal and automatic)</strike>

### DONE Support Cornell Notes
<strike>Implement support for Cornell Notes, https://m.wikihow.com/Take-Cornell-Notes</strike>

### DONE <strike>by serettig in Advanced Fill in the Blanks Select for Fill in the blanks</strike>

Instead of free text blanks, fill in the blanks might also be used to optionally present a select input field with different options
</strike>

### DONE <strike>QuestionSet</strike>
<strike>Check ImageScaling for intro inside column</strike>

### DONE <strike>Bugfix: Text size in DialogCards inside Course Presentations</strike>
<strike>Cannot reproduce</strike>

### DONE <strike>Optionally store state in cookies/localStorage</strike>
<strike>There's a save content state option that stores the state of a content type if the user is logged in. Might be useful to optionally use cookies (web storage API), so this feature could work for anonymous users, too. https://h5p.org/comment/14994#comment-14994</strike>

### DONE <strike>WP-H5P-Resize-Hack</strike>
Simple H5P-Plugin for WordPress that continuously triggers a resize event on the window.

### DONE <strike>Content Type: Paragraph Writing Structure Strips</strike>
<strike>- Have multiple text input fields and a "strip" next to it indicating the suggested length of a paragraph in relation to other paragraphs, cmp. https://www.tes.com/teaching-resource/paragraph-writing-structure-strips-for-gcse-english-literature-aqa-11821384 or https://www.pinterest.de/pin/463307880411263982/ or https://jivespin.wordpress.com/2017/07/20/structure-strips-stripping-literacy-to-the-basics/ or https://doingsocialstudies.com/2018/02/22/structure-strips-seriously-where-have-you-been-hiding/</strike>

<strike>- Allow to set some slack. e.g +/- 10 % of characters or words</strike>
<strike>- Allow to customize feedback messages if a paragraph subceeds/exceeds</strike>
<strike>- Save content state for revision, cmp. Cornell Notes</strike>

### Set slide duration for Course Presentation
It was nice if one could set a period of time after which a course presentations jumps to the next slide automatically. Might be fun for petcha kutcha or similar things. I already had some code to do this, but it got lost :-/

### H5P Paint
Just a content type to create some doodles and store them -- might be interesting to wrap images in xAPI ;-)

### H5P Annotate
- Container like content type that will put a timeline-ish comment section next to other content types for (collaborative) annotation, e.g. next to video or audio.
- Allow to jump from comment to video/audio and vice-versa.
- Would need some mechanism for sharing data among users in collaboration mode.

### H5P Mandelbrot
Just for fun, a generator for fractals

### H5P Swipe
A content type/(library for other content types?) to answer yes, no, foo or bar by swiping left, right, up or down

### H5P GraphQuiz
I wrote that on a sheet of paper, but I cannot remember what I wanted to create named this way ;-)
Might have been something like Capira offered: Teachers can draw a graph as a sample, and learners have to draw a graph that's similar enough. Could as well have been something such as https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/

### Timer
I have already created a general timer library for H5P, quite versatile, but I do not even dare to look at that old piece of code ;-) Maybe I'll write something new, tiny and focussed and ready for adding a timer (maybe as an overlay) to any H5P library that needs one. Could also go into H5P-Question.

### H5P OnSite
In order so support blended learning scenarios that use xAPI statements, an on-site tool might be useful. It it's simplest version it could just trigger an xAPI statement for "attended" when someone (within a particular group/range) clicks a button. A more sophisticated version could also offer some audience response system features.

### Word cloud
Simple content type (with possibly complex variations for fun): Create a word cloud from a list of words similar to https://www.wordclouds.com/

### IFTTT connection
Having an option to trigger IFTTT recipes based on xAPI statements could be real fun!

### Question Set
Allow multi-tier-questions, cmp. https://h5p.org/node/204840

### Multiple-Choice
- Add discrete option mode, cmp. https://h5p.org/node/204855
- Add confidence weighting mode

### Code feedback
Is there a service with an open API that could be used to unit test code and return some results to H5P? ...
- Possibly, something feasible is mentioned in https://h5p.org/node/310680

### 3D model display
It might be an interesting option to have a "3D image" content type that takes a standard 3D model file as input (research: what's standard?) and just displays it with some basic interaction options such as rotating or zooming. I bet there's already an open implementation for that (based on ThreeJS) that could be wrapped and used in H5P.

### Variable system
There might be cases where you want to (semi-)dynamically create content instead of creating several instances.
- Add variables, e. g. ${foo} that should not conflict with other texts.
- Add json file with possible values for a variable to h5p scheme.
- Big question: How to edit the files?

### Transcript library
A library that can be used to use (not create) transcripts with audio content or video content.
- Show transcript of an audio file/video file (based on .vtt captions or similar)
- Show currently used text phrase as audio/video progresses (on "caption" update, trigger with time as data)
- Jump to position in audio/video on clicking on the text (on click, trigger with time as data)

### Make rewind in IV more flexible
- Set time for rewinding

### Content type for JSMOL
[JSMOL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jmol/) seems 
to be a library for rendering molecules in HTML5. Creating an H5P content type that displays the corresponding files is probably simple. The more challenging, but also cooler part would be to implement a decent editor.

### Text utilities
The text utilities library could also benefit from some syllable/word/sentence counting capabilities (+Flesch-Kincaid, ...), might be some extra library, too.

### Add video option for flash cards
Currently, flash cards can contain images, but not videos. Having videos as well, could e.g. enable support for sign language.

### Create general import interface (the name is not accurate, but an insider joke ;-))
There are many great sources for all kinds of input on the internet, but there's no way to utilize them to automatically create H5P content. It still needs to be done manually. Things to think about:
- "all" that needs to be done is to transform input into a valid content.json file, basically mapping input fields to the right places.
- semantics.json contains all the information about the structure of H5P content, needs to be taken into account for mapping input, because the structure may change. Field names are unique for each level - but may be nested and fields may contain arrays aka lists.
- If there are no arrays/lists containing arrays/lists themselves (as in Essay for example with a list of words containing a list of alternatives), this could be represented using a table structure with each row containing the field name (and a certain data type implicitly) and columns covering list items if multiple items are possible. Groups could be represented as fieldname.groupitemname. The table structure could easily be made editable using common spreadsheet software.
- Alternatively, create an editor that first parses the current semantics file, allows to define sources and take fields from then and where to map them to.

### Create a set of learning elements for sign language
Cmp. https://morr.cc/anki-dgs/

### Tic Tac Toe
Just some finger gymnastics :-)

### setWhen
Similar to showWhen widget. Set a field property based on rules

### H5P Questionnaire
Some new libraries that could be used
- Media (Image, Audio, Video) as interstitial between pages
- Some numeric input, could be a slider or something similar
- Some numeric input, Likert scaled

### Add images as answer option to multiple choice?
Use images instead of text for answers. Might need some UX expertise

### Link-Widget
Check if link exists while it is entered

### xAPI for DialogCards
No technical challenge, but modeling is tricky, especially for the repetition mode.

### Spaced Repetition for FlashCards
- same mechanics as for DialogCards
- xAPI

### Customization functions
- Add some helper functions for semantics customization
  - e.g. find a semantics field by path/best effort
  - maybe even some WordPress admin settings

### Enhance copyright view
- Add machine readable license information, cmp. [OERHoernchen](https://oerhoernchen.de/about)

### Content Slider
Content type that is similar to the [Image Slider](https://h5p.org/image-slider), but for content types -- which would be similar to Question Set, but is not supposed to take care of scoring.

### alter_metadata hook
Metadata can already be altered using the alter_params hook, but only for subcontent. The meta data for the content type itself is not exposed as it doesn't reside in the params object. It was nice to be able to alter metadata, too, e.g. set a different default license, so it would not have to be set manually each time. An alter_metadata hook might help (could either only give access to the metadata object in extras or pass a reference to all metadata objects in extras and params). Alternatively, an alter_extras hook might help, too.

### Puzzle Game
- Upload an image, define the dimensions, and let people puzzle
- Design option: https://h5ptechnology.atlassian.net/browse/HFP-1730

### ToBeNamed
- Tool to design a network of nodes that process numerical inputs and return numerical outputs.
- Processing in nodes can be controlled by widgets (e. g. "sum" to add all inputs and return the sum as output.
- Nodes can also be inputs (number input field, slider, ...)
- Nodes can also be outputs (numbers, colors, sounds, ...)

### WordPress-PlugIn
- Add development mode option
- Add library development + option

### Memory
- Add videos -- but keep an eye on the editor, should probably be improved UX-wise.
- Add text
- Optionally enlarge images on click on card that was turned already
- Check stylesheet for error

### Core/Plugins
Add option to skip reset, can be useful if you simply changed a typo or something minor.

### ChemJax
Look into supporting ChemJax (similar to MathJax)

### WP-H5P-Leaderboard
PlugIn that allows to add a leaderboard to a post based on the scores achieved for a H5P content type.
- logged in users only based of H5P internal scores? Or use xAPI from xAPIkatchu, if available, for anonymous users, too?
- setting for maximum number of scores displayed (paged possibly)
- setting for anonymous users
- for logged in users: have their position highlighted
- modes: all scores vs. just next/previous user + score vs. gap to the top vs. ...
- Show a leaderboard below a content type (show/hide on xAPI answered)
- Different views: full vs. next one ahead / below
- pages for long boards

### Tabs
Like Accordion, but using Tabs

### Linked List Widget
Editor widget for lists that knows the current entity's index and can link to other list entities using select field that only contains existing nodes and updates the fields on changes (e. g. update the links when a node in between has been removed).

### Label exercise
Have a background image and drag text input fields onto the image in order to have an exercise for labeling; could also feature strokes to link to labels next to the image

### Dice Roller
Just a simple die/dice content type:
* Fullscreen (useful for smartphones)

* Number of dice
* Color of dice
* Custom images (but still numbers internally)

### Datepicker widget for editor
Says it all :-)

### "view_h5p_contents" capability for WordPress plugin
If set, users should at least be able to view the list of H5P contents (including the buttons that should be visible for viewing results and for editing content based on the other capabilities).

### Image-Widget
- Add option to include link to image.

### Metadata retrieval
Look into ways to retrieve metadata from media and use them in H5P directly. 

### Circuit Simulator content type
Why not have a (simple) wrapper for https://github.com/kazuhikoarase/simcirjs?

### Margin widget for images
Widget that allows to add a margin around images (particularly useful for Drag and Drop)
- margin top, right, bottom and left
- background color for the margin
- preview of the proportions

### Magnifying option for H5P.Image
Add an option to magnify parts of an image similar what's common in web shops.

### Piano Question
New content type, basically a multiple choice question, but using a piano keyboard as input

### Taboo
Content Type for the (reversed) Taboo game.
- Like dialog cards, add cards with taboo words
- Have a reversed mode where words must be included and need to be checked

### 3D model support
Add 3D model support to H5P.Image and the core widget using an appropriate library.

### DragQuestion
- Add option to keep correct items in place.
- Add white space next to image for putting draggables there

### Whats5P ;-)
Content type that's similar to a Question Set, but that has a vertical layout resembling a chat window including texts in between exercises.
- Could get a separate reporting class for more sophisticated analysis across exercises.
- Cmp. https://toolbot.glitch.me/
- Cmp. https://learningsnacks.de

### Timer Content Type
Just a simple stop watch / countdown timer content type.

### Categorizator
Compound Content Type that allows to add content types (media), attach tags to them and then allow to filter them for the tags, etc.

### Kewar: Add "description" field
Add "description" field to QR code that can be displayed along with the QRCode

### General Feedback
Allow links, could facilitate paths

### Multiple Choice
Option for "neither right nor wrong"

### Audio

- Add Audio Recorder?

### Content Type: Spreadsheet Question
Pretty straightforward: have a table with some filled/unfilled cells - and the latter to be filled

### Drag the Words
Allow alternatives, keep xAPI extension/correct responses pattern in mind

### Scuh
Point-and-Click-Adventure-like (probably too much effort for teachers to create those)
* Rooms (image background with hotspots + NPCs)
* Inventory (items)
actions = use item + (item / hotspot / NPC)

### Spot the mistakes
The teacher can write a text including deliberately misspelled words/wrong punctuation marks. The student needs to spot the mistakes, mark and correct them.

### Content Type: Visualization
Wrapper for https://www.chartjs.org to have multiple chart options in one content type.

### Accordion: Use Column as content wrapper

### (Collaborative) Post-it organizer
Could be something like GoogleKeep, but open (Multiplayer API needed)

### DialogCards
Support other algorithms such as SM2 in Anki or SuperMemo.

### Multiple Choice
- Make : escapable as \\:

### MathDisplay
Add KaTeX support

### "GameMap"
Compound Content Type similar to Image Hotspots, but ...
- allow any kind of content type
- allow to track progress
- allow to define prerequisites for enabling hotspots
- display the current "position"
- think of it as the map in Super Mario Wold

### Image
Add option to use link instead of uploading image

### Interactive Video: Chapter Marks
YouTube added a chapter feature by using the description for marks. Check if it is possible to retrieve those and use them to build chapters in H5P automatically.

### Image Hotspots: individual color
- https://h5p.org/node/1018665

### Content Type: Text correction
Spot mistakes in a text and correct them. Could become a feature of Highlight the Words or a spin-off.

### Interactive Video: Countdown
- As an author, I want to be able to add a countdown to interactions that will automatically check the task/close the interaction overlay when the timer reaches zero.
  - Check vs close (disable retry if check or it doesn't make much sense)
  - Visual timer vs. hidden timer (where to put the timer?)

### WordPress-Plugin: Timed questions
- As an author, I want to set a maximum time for H5P content in order to limit the amount of time that people can spend with the content.
  - Could call "showSolutions" via H5P question type contract
  - Could block editing by injecting an overlay (on same server)
  - Could show a timer (positioning?)
  - Optionally implement functions in H5P core (approval needed)
