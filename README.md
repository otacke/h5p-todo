## Ideas and todos

### Replace 'title' attribute
In all content types, replace use of 'title' attribute where used with H5P.Tooltip or remove alltogether if not necessary.

### DONE <strike>H5P Bingo</strike>
<strike>
- Content type for playing bingo at boring conferences -- create your bingo sheet, share, enjoy ;-)
- Enter pool of bingo words, content type will randomly generate an x by x bingo sheet
</strike>

### DONE <strike>Add setAudio function to H5P Question (already in prototype state)</strike>
<strike>H5P Question is a library that offers common functionality to question-like content types. It already features setImage and setVideo for easily including an image or a video for the content types introduction, but setAudio is missing.</strike>

### DONE <strike>Add video option to dialog cards</strike>
<strike>Currently, dialog cards can contain images, but not videos. Having videos as well, could e.g. enable support for sign language.</strike>

### <strike>H5P.PDF</strike>
<strike>Simple PDF-Viewer content type, could be based on [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js). Rather not to prevent even more PDF overuse.</strike>

### DONE <strike>DialogCards</strike>
<strike>
- cmp. https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/unlock-spaced-repetition-for-h5p-dialog-cards/x/824080
- Save Content State
- Reset button for repetition mode to start over again
</strike>

### DONE BY SOMEONE ELSE <strike>Hangman</strike>
<strike>Self-explanatory. Maybe score + timing would be nice.</strike>

### DONE <strike>Auto-Progression for Image Slider</strike>
<strike>- Option to progress to the next image automatically after a given time period (should be reset after interaction?)
- Option to jump from last to first/first to last image instead of stopping (normal and automatic)</strike>

### DONE Support Cornell Notes
<strike>Implement support for Cornell Notes, https://m.wikihow.com/Take-Cornell-Notes</strike>

### DONE <strike>by serettig in Advanced Fill in the Blanks Select for Fill in the blanks</strike>
<strike>
Instead of free text blanks, fill in the blanks might also be used to optionally present a select input field with different options
</strike>

### DONE <strike>QuestionSet</strike>
<strike>Check ImageScaling for intro inside column</strike>

### DONE <strike>Bugfix: Text size in DialogCards inside Course Presentations</strike>
<strike>Cannot reproduce</strike>

### DONE <strike>Optionally store state in cookies/localStorage</strike>
<strike>There's a save content state option that stores the state of a content type if the user is logged in. Might be useful to optionally use cookies (web storage API), so this feature could work for anonymous users, too. https://h5p.org/comment/14994#comment-14994</strike>

### DONE <strike>WP-H5P-Resize-Hack</strike>
Simple H5P-Plugin for WordPress that continuously triggers a resize event on the window.

### DONE <strike>Content Type: Paragraph Writing Structure Strips</strike>
<strike>- Have multiple text input fields and a "strip" next to it indicating the suggested length of a paragraph in relation to other paragraphs, cmp. https://www.tes.com/teaching-resource/paragraph-writing-structure-strips-for-gcse-english-literature-aqa-11821384 or https://www.pinterest.de/pin/463307880411263982/ or https://jivespin.wordpress.com/2017/07/20/structure-strips-stripping-literacy-to-the-basics/ or https://doingsocialstudies.com/2018/02/22/structure-strips-seriously-where-have-you-been-hiding/</strike>
<strike>- Allow to set the weight of each paragraph</strike>
<strike>- Allow to set the color of a paragraph strip</strike>
<strike>- Allow to set some slack. e.g +/- 10 % of characters or words</strike>
<strike>- Allow to customize feedback messages if a paragraph subceeds/exceeds</strike>
<strike>- Save content state for revision, cmp. Cornell Notes</strike>

### DONE <strike>ImageHotspots</strike>
<strike>Add Audio</strike>

### Course Presentation
- Transitions
  - Duration
  - Style (e. g. slide (as now), over black, nothing, ...)
  - Auto-progress: It was nice if one could set a period of time after which a course presentations jumps to the next slide automatically. Might be fun for petcha kutcha or similar things. I already had some code to do this, but it got lost :-/

### H5P Paint
Just a content type to create some doodles and store them -- might be interesting to wrap images in xAPI ;-)

### H5P Annotate
- Container like content type that will put a timeline-ish comment section next to other content types for (collaborative) annotation, e.g. next to video or audio.
- Allow to jump from comment to video/audio and vice-versa.
- Would need some mechanism for sharing data among users in collaboration mode.

### H5P Mandelbrot
Just for fun, a generator for fractals

### H5P Swipe
A content type/(library for other content types?) to answer yes, no, foo or bar by swiping left, right, up or down

### H5P GraphQuiz
I wrote that on a sheet of paper, but I cannot remember what I wanted to create named this way ;-)
Might have been something like Capira offered: Teachers can draw a graph as a sample, and learners have to draw a graph that's similar enough. Could as well have been something such as https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/

### Timer
I have already created a general timer library for H5P, quite versatile, but I do not even dare to look at that old piece of code ;-) Maybe I'll write something new, tiny and focussed and ready for adding a timer (maybe as an overlay) to any H5P library that needs one. Could also go into H5P-Question.

### H5P OnSite
In order so support blended learning scenarios that use xAPI statements, an on-site tool might be useful. It it's simplest version it could just trigger an xAPI statement for "attended" when someone (within a particular group/range) clicks a button. A more sophisticated version could also offer some audience response system features.

### Word cloud
Simple content type (with possibly complex variations for fun): Create a word cloud from a list of words similar to https://www.wordclouds.com/

### IFTTT connection
Having an option to trigger IFTTT recipes based on xAPI statements could be real fun!

### Question Set
Allow multi-tier-questions, cmp. https://h5p.org/node/204840

### Multiple-Choice
- Add discrete option mode, cmp. https://h5p.org/node/204855
- Add confidence weighting mode

### Code feedback
Is there a service with an open API that could be used to unit test code and return some results to H5P? ...
- Possibly, something feasible is mentioned in https://h5p.org/node/310680

### 3D model display
It might be an interesting option to have a "3D image" content type that takes a standard 3D model file as input (research: what's standard?) and just displays it with some basic interaction options such as rotating or zooming. I bet there's already an open implementation for that (based on ThreeJS) that could be wrapped and used in H5P.

### Variable system
There might be cases where you want to (semi-)dynamically create content instead of creating several instances.
- Add variables, e. g. ${foo} that should not conflict with other texts.
- Add json file with possible values for a variable to h5p scheme.
- Big question: How to edit the files?

### Transcript library (probably tackled soon)
A library that can be used to use (not create) transcripts with audio content or video content.
- Show transcript of an audio file/video file (based on .vtt captions or similar)
- Show currently used text phrase as audio/video progresses (on "caption" update, trigger with time as data)
- Jump to position in audio/video on clicking on the text (on click, trigger with time as data)

### Make rewind in IV more flexible
- Set time for rewinding

### Content type for JSMOL
[JSMOL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jmol/) seems 
to be a library for rendering molecules in HTML5. Creating an H5P content type that displays the corresponding files is probably simple. The more challenging, but also cooler part would be to implement a decent editor.

### Text utilities
The text utilities library could also benefit from some syllable/word/sentence counting capabilities (+Flesch-Kincaid, ...), might be some extra library, too.

### Add video option for flash cards
Currently, flash cards can contain images, but not videos. Having videos as well, could e.g. enable support for sign language.

### Create general import interface (the name is not accurate, but an insider joke ;-))
There are many great sources for all kinds of input on the internet, but there's no way to utilize them to automatically create H5P content. It still needs to be done manually. Things to think about:
- "all" that needs to be done is to transform input into a valid content.json file, basically mapping input fields to the right places.
- semantics.json contains all the information about the structure of H5P content, needs to be taken into account for mapping input, because the structure may change. Field names are unique for each level - but may be nested and fields may contain arrays aka lists.
- If there are no arrays/lists containing arrays/lists themselves (as in Essay for example with a list of words containing a list of alternatives), this could be represented using a table structure with each row containing the field name (and a certain data type implicitly) and columns covering list items if multiple items are possible. Groups could be represented as fieldname.groupitemname. The table structure could easily be made editable using common spreadsheet software.
- Alternatively, create an editor that first parses the current semantics file, allows to define sources and take fields from then and where to map them to.

### Create a set of learning elements for sign language
Cmp. https://morr.cc/anki-dgs/

### Tic Tac Toe
Just some finger gymnastics :-)

### setWhen
Similar to showWhen widget. Set a field property based on rules

### H5P Questionnaire
Some new libraries that could be used
- Media (Image, Audio, Video) as interstitial between pages
- Some numeric input, could be a slider or something similar
- Some numeric input, Likert scaled

### Add images as answer option to multiple choice?
Use images instead of text for answers. Might need some UX expertise

### Link-Widget
Check if link exists while it is entered

### xAPI for DialogCards
No technical challenge, but modeling is tricky, especially for the repetition mode.

### Spaced Repetition for FlashCards
- same mechanics as for DialogCards
- xAPI

### Customization functions
- Add some helper functions for semantics customization
  - e.g. find a semantics field by path/best effort
  - maybe even some WordPress admin settings

### Enhance copyright view
- Add machine readable license information, cmp. [OERHoernchen](https://oerhoernchen.de/about)

### Content Slider
Content type that is similar to the [Image Slider](https://h5p.org/image-slider), but for content types -- which would be similar to Question Set, but is not supposed to take care of scoring. Could use the engine of ImageChoiceRounds.

### alter_metadata hook
Metadata can already be altered using the alter_params hook, but only for subcontent. The meta data for the content type itself is not exposed as it doesn't reside in the params object. It was nice to be able to alter metadata, too, e.g. set a different default license, so it would not have to be set manually each time. An alter_metadata hook might help (could either only give access to the metadata object in extras or pass a reference to all metadata objects in extras and params). Alternatively, an alter_extras hook might help, too.

### Puzzle Game
- Upload an image, define the dimensions, and let people puzzle
- Design option: https://h5ptechnology.atlassian.net/browse/HFP-1730
- :-)

### ToBeNamed
- Tool to design a network of nodes that process numerical inputs and return numerical outputs.

- Add contentId obfuscation: Use UUID instead of auto-incremented index
- Improve tracking of results incl. support for https://github.com/h5p/h5p-php-report
- Include support for the H5P OER Hub (probably done by the H5P core team soon)
- Add option reset task for specific users
- Add option to not reset the state when editing content

  - Better filtering
  - Delete content(s) in list directly
  - ...

#### WP-H5P-Leaderboard
PlugIn that allows to add a leaderboard to a post based on the scores achieved for a H5P content type.

- Would work for users that are not logged in, too

### Memory
- Add videos -- but keep an eye on the editor, should probably be improved UX-wise.
- Add text
- Optionally enlarge images on click on card that was turned already
- Check stylesheet for error

### Arithmetic Quiz
Set number ranges, cmp. https://sommenprinter.nl/basisrekenenplusmin10.php

### Tabs (probably tackled soon)
Like Accordion, but using Tabs

### Linked List Widget
Editor widget for lists that knows the current entity's index and can link to other list entities using select field that only contains existing nodes and updates the fields on changes (e. g. update the links when a node in between has been removed).

Add an option to magnify parts of an image similar what's common in web shops.

### Piano Question
New content type, basically a multiple choice question, but using a piano keyboard as input

Content Type for the (reversed) Taboo game.
- Like dialog cards, add cards with taboo words

Point-and-Click-Adventure-like (probably too much effort for teachers to create those)
* Rooms (image background with hotspots + NPCs)
* Inventory (items)
actions = use item + (item / hotspot / NPC)

### Spot the mistakes
The teacher can write a text including deliberately misspelled words/wrong punctuation marks. The student needs to spot the mistakes, mark and correct them.

Wrapper for https://www.chartjs.org to have multiple chart options in one content type.

### (Collaborative) Post-it organizer
Could be something like GoogleKeep, but open (Multiplayer API needed)

### DialogCards
Support other algorithms such as SM2 in Anki or SuperMemo.

### Multiple Choice

### Content Type: Text correction/Work with Text
Spot mistakes in a text and correct them. Could become a feature of Highlight the Words or a spin-off.

### Interactive Video: Countdown
- As an author, I want to be able to add a countdown to interactions that will automatically check the task/close the interaction overlay when the timer reaches zero.
  - Check vs close (disable retry if check or it doesn't make much sense)
  - Visual timer vs. hidden timer (where to put the timer?)

### H5P Interactive Video
Fix size of popups that start as a button, not as a poster

Just a simple content type that presents the user with a number lock.
- variable number of digits

### Reading Trainer
Cmp. https://t.co/1rBAGXgRU1 but without the prephase that would require machine learning support or a free and open service to be used.
Could actually be done by optionally amending Speak the Words.
